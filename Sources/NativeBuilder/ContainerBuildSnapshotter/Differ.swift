/// A protocol for computing and storing filesystem diffs
///
/// The Differ is responsible for:
/// 1. Computing the delta between two filesystem states
/// 2. Serializing that delta into an OCI-compliant layer format
/// 3. Storing the layer to a content store
/// 4. Returning a descriptor that can be used in OCI manifests
public protocol Differ: Sendable {

    var contentStore: any ContentStore { get }

    ///
    /// This method performs the complete diff workflow:
    /// 1. Computes filesystem changes between base and target
    /// 2. Creates a tar archive of those changes
    /// 3. Applies the specified compression format
    /// 4. Stores the result to the content store
    /// 5. Returns a descriptor suitable for OCI manifests
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - base: The base snapshot (nil for initial/scratch layers)
    ///   - target: The target snapshot to diff against base
    ///   - format: The compression format to use for the layer
    ///   - metadata: Additional metadata to include in the descriptor annotations
    /// - Returns: A Descriptor containing the descriptor and statistics
    /// - Throws: If diff computation or storage fails

    /// - Materializing snapshots from cached layers
